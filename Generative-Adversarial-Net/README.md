## About
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GANs) to generate medical images. The GAN model has been trained on Chest X-ray dataset taken from here [https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). The trained GAN model is used to generate chest X-ray images.
